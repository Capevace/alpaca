			"content":"<p>I bought a robotic vacuum more out of curiosity and to see if I should buy one as a gift for my parents. Just one of the cheapest models that still had good reviews.<p>It turned out that all deficiencies of such a vacuum are offset by its basic function: it keeps the apartment clean each day, every day. Dirty corners? Weak suction? Small container? Somewhat noisy? Not too smart? Gets stuck sometimes? I need to clean hairs out of the rotating brush? I still have to mop the place? Pffft, none of this matters when the carpet and the kitchen are dust-free <i>every day</i> without me doing the vacuuming. If it misses a spot today, it will get it tomorrow. After a few runs the floor is indeed cleaner than it ever was, and stays that way. No rogue crumbs stuck to my feet before the cleanup day. Still managed to find something unpleasant on the floor? Just give the robot a bit of work right here. It&#x27;s like SSDs after HDDs: you have to worry about having backups, but it&#x27;ll be amazing in the meantime.<p>Rather prophetically, the cheap production has shown itself when something got cooked in the electronic insides and the vac entered the eternity of ‘error 03’.",

Additionally it left random patterns in the carpet that could only be described as a drunk toddler vacuuming... in other words, it didn&#x27;t look clean. It took more than 3 days to map the three rooms that it was supposed to clean, getting stuck away from it&#x27;s base unable to return because it&#x27;s charge ran out. It would also get stuck under my bed. I&#x27;m not certain how it&#x27;s possible that it could have done a worse job.

For humans you have to limit complexity, the robot cant get enough of it.<p>The trick is to do a great job with the least runtime and perfect timing.<p>1 (Highest frequency): The visible areas when walking from the front door to the seat where your guests will sit. The entire house can be either 1) a complete mess, it will still look clean. Or 2) the entire house can be supper clean it still wont look clean.<p>Some cameras would be nifty here.<p>1.1: edges for 1<p>2: Same as 1 for all frequently used paths in the house except those covered by 1. Could split this up into levels of frequency.<p>2.1: edges for 2<p>3rd: All open surfaces not covered by 1 and 2.<p>3.1: all edges not covered by 1.1 and 2.1<p>The edges are done roughly every 4th round.<p>The 1st it can do multiple times per day depending on traffic. (1 times is a good minimum) It could by a dynamic number based on motion sensors. Timing is everything, if the room is empty it can do its thing for 2-3 minutes (quit if someone walks in) Nr 2 is done half to 1&#x2F;3 as frequent as 1. Nr 3 is done half to 1&#x2F;3 as frequent as 2.<p>I&#x27;ve used the above system for years and it continues to amaze me how quick one can execute the routine and how clean everything looks. Nr 1 sometimes takes no more than a gaze around the room.<p>Without such system one just does &quot;everything&quot; every time which is a lot more work than it seems.

If we want it to clean where the chairlegs are, we just move the chairs against the wall the night before and move them back the following evening when we get back from work.<p>3) I feel like this is a cheap shot: it doesn&#x27;t clean bathtubs or toilet bowls either (and like windowsills, it doesn&#x27;t advertise to clean those, either).<p>4) No. It may be round, but it has two rotating brushes placed towards the front which get dust and crumbs out of corners, but the brush&#x2F;vacuum portion itself <i>does not</i> reach right to the edges of the machine, so you&#x27;re unlikely to get deep cleaning on the edges of carpets.<p>Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with it: it consistently comes back with a lot of dust and crumbs in its bin (we run it Mon, Wed, Fri), replacement parts (e.g. brushes) are <i>cheap</i> from the usual suspects in China, the edge cleaning is more intelligent than discussed by the linked article, and the floor under our sofa (a heavy 3-seater) has never been so consistently dust-free.",

			"content":"<p>Robot vacuums have been such a game changer for me. It&#x27;s funny because functionally they are worse than a cordless sick or full-size vacuum in almost every way. However being able to turn it on before I head for work everyday makes a giant difference.<p>One thing I am skeptical of is robot vacuums that connect to the internet. Some of the higher end Roombas do that and I&#x27;m skeptical that it makes them more efficient.

I&#x27;ve got the Eufy RoboVac 11S and would highly recommend it. Unlike my previous Roomba, it doesn&#x27;t speed up before bumping into things—it mostly avoids it. Also, it is significantly quieter.",
